# VR-Programming
This repository is intended to mantain the code of my Undergraduate Thesis Project on Informatics Engineering. It consists on a blog on which I'll be publishing all the progress I make, you can check it out [here](https://jdjuli.github.io/vr-programming/)

# About

My thesis aims to explore how it would be to program on a VR environment, as it's a technology that is becoming more and more available and affordable. 
On the first days of the computers, programmers had to use perforated cards, but when screens became available, more complex tools such as IDEs came up and later on, the evolution of the computer graphics brought us tools like [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), that allow us to write programs with geometric forms instead of writing code.

# What technologies are being used?

To generate the blog, I'm using [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) and to serve the webpage on my LAN (for development and troubleshooting purposes), a python script called `HTTPS_server.py`.

The Javascript libraries I'm using to build the VR scenes are:
 - [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/)
 - [aframe-extras](https://github.com/n5ro/aframe-extras)
 - [aframe-physics-system](https://github.com/n5ro/aframe-physics-system)
 - [aframe-super-hands-component](https://github.com/wmurphyrd/aframe-super-hands-component)

# I want to see the code and run it

I'm using an iterative approach on this proyect and you can see each of my steps under the folder `/static/demos/` of this repository, each folder contains everything needed to run the VR-Scene. 
You can run the scenes directly from their URL, but I recommend you to check out the [blog](https://jdjuli.github.io/vr-programming/) first, as on it I'll explain what to expect from each demo and how to interact with it.
