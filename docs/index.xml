      <description>On this iteration, the main objectives are:
 Ensure that the scenes can be used on PC and Oculus Quest. Create an element specifically intended for executing the program (a &amp;ldquo;run&amp;rdquo; button) Modify the program component so it creates a platform on which, by dropping the blocks, the user can create the program.  Scenes created  Demonstration of component &amp;ldquo;multidevice&amp;rdquo; On this scene, the component multidevice takes care of detecting if the device is a VR headset or not and on each case, initializes the corresponding controllers.</description>

      <description>On this iteration the objectives are to improve the comunication between components and start making simple programming-oriented components.
Scenes developed   Listening for entity collisions
The scene represents a bunch of spheres bouncing and colliding, each time the spheres collide their color changes to red for a small time frame. To archieve this behaviour I created a component called &amp;ldquo;colorea_colision&amp;rdquo; that listens for &amp;ldquo;collide&amp;rdquo; events and changes the color of the attached entity for a short time.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of experience programming on Javascript before and also, as A-Frame is a component-based framework, the objectives of this first iteration are becoming familiar with Javascript and A-Frame.
This first scenes are very basic and not so interactive, because I used them as &amp;ldquo;prototypes&amp;rdquo; for the next ones, I decided to keep them to ilustrate my progress.
Scenes developed   Non parametric component
This scene shows one brown sphere, it&amp;rsquo;s entity element on the DOM has the attribute &amp;ldquo;esfera_marron&amp;rdquo; set, which maps to the component with the same name.</description>

      <description>Hello! My name is Julián Sánchez and this blog is part of my bachelor thesis on Informatic Engineering.
About the proyect This proyect aims to create a virtual environment in which, the users could build programs that allow them to move a virtual drone. The main focus is to exploit all the advantages of the virtual reality in contrast with the 2D environments, such as the well-known IDEs.
Where did the idea came from?</description>
