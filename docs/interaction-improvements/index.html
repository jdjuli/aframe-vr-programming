  <div class="post-content"><p>My thesis mentor gave me the idea of improving the interaction by implementing a previewing dynamic that allows the user to view how would the program look like if a certain instruction is added. I&rsquo;ve took the previous demo 16 as the base to implement this preview and instead of overwriting the scene, I decided to create a new one to avoid anyone interested on following my progress having to navigate through the repository commits and start a webserver on their own to test it.</p>
<h2 id="how-is-instruction-previewing-implemented">How is instruction previewing implemented:</h2>
<p>I tried to keep the process as simple and powerfull as possible and I ended up modifying the <code>instruction</code> component to have another parameter on it&rsquo;s schema that will tell if the instruction should behave as a preview or not, and with that in mind, I&rsquo;ve added to the program and every instruction the component <code>droppable</code>, which let me react to the events of hovering the instruction while grabbing an entity with the component <code>draggable</code> attached. The following event listeners were implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>drag-drop</code>: When this event is detected, it means that an instruction has been ungrabed while hovering the entity that receives the event (the user has dropped it there). As a response to this event, the dropped entity is attached on top of the entity it has been dropped over.</li>
<li><code>dragover-start</code>: This event fires when the user hovers an entity while grabbing a <code>draggable</code> entity and as a response to this, the grabbed entity is previewed in the place it would take if dropped in that position.</li>
<li><code>dragover-end</code>: This event is the opposite of <code>dragover-start</code>, because <code>dragover</code> is not like the <code>hit</code> event, that is fired every tick while the super-hand is colliding with something and hence, the appropiate reaction to <code>dragover-end</code> is to end the preview of the instruction (removing the entity with the preview attribute from the scene).</li>
</ul>
<p>The end of the preview maybe is not the best approach, as it could be improved by just updating the <code>instruction</code> component disabling it&rsquo;s &lsquo;preview mode&rsquo;, but as I wanted to keep it as simple as possible, I add a new entity with the <code>instruction</code> component cloned from the grabbed entity and the &lsquo;preview mode&rsquo; enabled through the <code>preview</code> node of the <code>instruction</code> schema, and the removal is even simplier, I just need to keep a variable pointing to the entity that holds the preview to remove it, and this way, limiting the previewing entities to only one at a time is as simple as checking if I&rsquo;m already storing a reference to a preview and if so, discard the new preview until the previous one ends.</p>
<h2 id="minor-changes">Minor changes</h2>
<p>At the same time I&rsquo;ve implemented the preview of instructions, I&rsquo;d retaken the idea of interacting with the hand menu using physics as it makes it more precise. On the demo you can use it by following this steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the hand menu pressing the left joystick</li>
<li>Make a &lsquo;pointing&rsquo; gesture with the right hand (a white wireframe box will appear on the index finger)</li>
<li>Push the buttons of the left hand menu with the index finger of the right hand. Use the arrows <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> to navigate through the different instructions available and press one of them to create it on the right of the program.</li>
<li>Now you can close the menu by pressing the left joystick again or change the selected instruction by pressing another one.</li>
</ol>
<p>As usual, I&rsquo;ll provide the links to the demo and the code as well as some images demonstrating the changes.</p>

<h2 id="known-issues">Known issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<h4 id="unresponsive-hand-menu">Unresponsive hand menu</h4>
I&rsquo;ve found that after pressing the buttons of the hand menu, sometimes they become unresponsive. I haven&rsquo;t discovered yet why does this happens because it seems to be a problem within the physics system as no <code>collidestart</code> event is received and hence, the collision cannot be detected. Temporarily, this issue can be mitigated by opening and closing the menu (that destroys and creates again the buttons).</li>
<li>
<h4 id="apparently-random-crashes-or-disappearing-blocks">Apparently random crashes or disappearing blocks</h4>
This could happen if the hand is shaked over the program while grabbing an instruction and the explanation is that as the <code>dragover</code> and <code>drag-drop</code> events are handled asyncronously, it could happen that the entity they have to be notified or refer to, existed at the time of firing the event but doesn&rsquo;t exist by the time it is handled. I have to investigate more about how to solve this, but for now, the best &lsquo;solution&rsquo; I found so far is to avoid pushing the scene to it&rsquo;s limits and try to preview the instructions at one place at a time.</li>
<li>
<h4 id="entities-blink-when-they-are-added-or-removed-tofrom-the-program">Entities blink when they are added or removed to/from the program</h4>
This happens because the entities are reparented by creating a clone and modifying it&rsquo;s position, some flickering might occur sometimes if the entities are rendered before being removed or having it&rsquo;s position updated. As far as I have test, this side-effect of cloning entities is harmless, but I&rsquo;ll keep an eye on it just in case it becomes problematic in the future.</li>
